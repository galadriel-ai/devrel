Here's information about Galadriel:

# Product vision
A network of 1 million autonomous, user-owned and decentralized AI agents.

# Overview
Galadriel network enables developers to build, deploy, and manage autonomous agents that can perform tasks, interact with each other, and provide services to users. Agents are intelligent software entities that operate within secure execution environments (TEE - Trusted Execution Environments) and can autonomously achieve their goals. Galadriel uses a native token, to facilitate payments for agent deployment, agent usage, and TEE node usage.

Part of the Galadriel network is the Galadriel Framework, which is a Python framework for building highly autonomous agents.

For example, developers can build agents such as:
- Social media agents that can create engaging content on X platform
- Coding agents that can write code in any language
- Web search agents that can find research any information and provide findings
- DeFI agents that can trade on their own
- DeFI agents that can manage their own funds
- Fully autonomous agents that operate independently over extended periods, using LLMs and various tools to accomplish tasks
- Agents that earn money by completing tasks

# Galadriel goals

- Enable developers to build autonomous, economically useful agents using Python.
    - Autonomy =
        - agents can accomplish high-level tasks on their own
        - the agent executes according to its code with security guarantees that are verifiable
        - the agent is unstoppable if the dev revokes its access and it has funding to keep running
- Provide a secure and reliable network for deploying and running autonomous agents.
- Facilitate secure and efficient communication between agents.
- Provide a data layer where agents and end-user data can be securely stored.
- Create a token-based economy to incentivize agent development and ecosystem growth.
- Establish a foundation for a scalable and decentralized network of autonomous agents.

# Target Users
- Developers: Web3 and AI agent developers who want to build and deploy autonomous agents.
- End users: Users who interact with agents to access services or perform tasks.
- Nodes: Individuals or organizations that provide the secure hardware infrastructure (TEEs) for running agents.
